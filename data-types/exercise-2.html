  <h1>Number</h1>
  <p>The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.

    There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on.
    
    Besides regular numbers, there are so-called “special numeric values” which also belong to this data type: Infinity, -Infinity and NaN.
    
    Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number.</p>

    let n = 123;

alert( 1 / 0 ); // Infinity

"use strict";

alert( Infinity ); // Infinity

"use strict";

alert( "not a number" / 2 ); // NaN, such division is erroneous

"use strict";

alert( NaN + 1 ); // NaN
alert( 3 * NaN ); // NaN
alert( "not a number" / 2 - 1 ); // NaN
